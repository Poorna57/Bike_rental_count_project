Problem Statement  
 
The objective of this case study is the prediction of bike rental count on daily based on the environmental 
and seasonal settings. The dataset contains 731 observations, 15 predictors and 1 target variable. The 
predictors are describing various environment factors and settings like season, humidity etc. We need to 
build a prediction model to predict estimated count or demand of bikes on a particular day based on the 
environmental factors
